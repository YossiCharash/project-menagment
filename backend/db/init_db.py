Database initialization - creates all tables, enums, and indexes.
All database schema is defined in the SQLAlchemy models in backend/models/
and backend/cems/models/.

This file creates missing tables via create_all (which never alters existing
tables). A small set of *additive, idempotent* column migrations that create_all
cannot apply to pre-existing tables are applied explicitly on startup — see
``_apply_additive_migrations``. Larger schema changes still go through the SQL
scripts in backend/migrations/.
